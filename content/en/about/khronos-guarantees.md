	  <h4>Time shifting attacks</h4>
	  <p>Analytical results show that if a local Khronos pool consists of 500 servers, 1/7 of whom are controlled by a machine-in-the-middle attacker, and 15 servers are queried in each Khronos poll interval, then success in shifting time of a Khronos client by even a small degree (100 ms), takes many years of effort (over 20 years in expectation).</p>
	  <h4>Dos Attacks</h4>
	  <p>In addition to evaluating the probability of an attacker successfully shifting time at the client's clock, we also evaluated the probability that the attacker succeeds in launching a DoS attack on the servers by causing many clients to enter a panic mode (and query all the servers in their local Khronos pools).</p>
	  <p>This probability is negligible even for an attacker who controls a large number of servers in client's local Khronos pools, and it is expected to take decades to force panic mode.</p>

          <p>The ratio (in log scale) between the probability that the attacker controls at least half of the queried servers (and can thus successfully attack todayâ€™s NTP clients) and the probability that the attacker controls two thirds of the queried servers (and can thus successfully attack Khronos) in one sampling iteration.</p>
