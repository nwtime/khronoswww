The Khronos Project aims to provide an extension to the NTPv4 client, which is used as a "watchdog" alongside NTPv4, and provides improved security against time shifting attacks.
   
Khronos involves changes to the NTP client's system process only. Since it does not affect the wire protocol, the Khronos mechanism is applicable to any current or future time protocol.
