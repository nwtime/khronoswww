1. Replace all instances of the REPLACEME string in config.toml with project-specific information, being careful to only replace the string and to leave any surrounding text and quotes. Dru can assist if you need to add/remove any social media or menu items.

2. The orange buttons on the homepage are defined in layouts/index.html. Replace the REPLACEME strings in this file with project-specific URLs and name.

3. The project name in the header is defined in layouts/partials/header.html. Replace the REPLACEME string in this file with the project name.

4. Update the README and replace capitalized strings with project-specific name, description, license, etc.

5. Once the site is deployed, delete this INSTRUCTIONS file from your project's repo.
